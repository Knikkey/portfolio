# My Portfolio

Take a look at what I can do! My Portfolio is a collection of projects that I have done, along with some info about me as a person. You can also find a contact page as well as my resume and a link to my GitHub, too! The current styling theme is based off of business cards, which are widely used in Japan and South Korea, where I lived for a total of 10 years.

While this isn't really an open source project (it is my own portfolio after all), I am open to critique and suggestions. Feel free to start a discussion.
